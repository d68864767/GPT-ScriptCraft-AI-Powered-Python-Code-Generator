# GPT-ScriptCraft: AI-Powered Python Code Generator

## Project Introduction and Purpose

GPT-ScriptCraft is a Python script that leverages GPT (Generative Pre-trained Transformer) technology to generate Python code snippets and scripts for common programming tasks. The script allows users to specify their coding needs and generate code that adheres to best practices and coding standards. This project aims to provide developers with a powerful tool for automating code generation and streamlining common coding tasks, offering a valuable resource for boosting productivity and creativity in Python scripting.

## Installation Instructions

1. Clone the repository to your local machine.
2. Navigate to the project directory.
3. Install the required packages using pip:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Usage Guide with Examples

To use GPT-ScriptCraft, run the `gpt_scriptcraft.py` script in your terminal:

```bash
python gpt_scriptcraft.py
```

You will be prompted to enter your OpenAI API key, the type of script you want to generate, the purpose of the script, and the desired parameters. You can also specify any variables or function names you want to customize in the generated code.

Here is an example of how to use GPT-ScriptCraft:

```bash
python gpt_scriptcraft.py
Please enter your OpenAI API key: ********
Enter the type of script you want to generate: data analysis
Enter the purpose of the script: analyze sales data
Enter the desired parameters (comma-separated): data_file, output_file
Enter any variables you want to specify (comma-separated): df, result
Enter any function names you want to specify (comma-separated): analyze_data, save_results
```

## Supported Code Types and Purposes

GPT-ScriptCraft can generate Python code for a wide range of script types and purposes, depending on the capabilities of the underlying GPT model.

## Customization Options

You can customize the generated code by specifying variables and function names. These customizations are applied after the code is generated.

## How GPT-ScriptCraft Works

GPT-ScriptCraft uses OpenAI's GPT API to generate Python code based on user-provided criteria. The user input is used to create a prompt for the GPT model, which then generates a Python script that matches the user's specifications.
